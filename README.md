### AI-Powered Customer Intelligence & Predictive Analytics Platform

*Churn prediction you can explain. Segments you can act on. Strategies an LLM writes from your actual data — not its imagination.*

## 🌟 Why NeuroScope Exists

Customer Success and Growth teams sit on raw telemetry but starve for insight: churn
risk lives in spreadsheets, segmentation is guesswork, and ML outputs are unreadable to
the people who need them.

**NeuroScope closes that gap** — one app that takes a customer CSV and returns:

| | Deliverable | How |
|---|---|---|
| 🔮 | **Churn risk scores** — with a *why* attached to every single prediction | 4 competing classifiers (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Extra Trees) on identical stratified splits, winner picked by AUC-ROC, explained via SHAP waterfalls |
| 🧩 | **Customer segments** — persona cards, radar profiles, 3D projections, CSV export | K-Means, DBSCAN & Hierarchical compete on silhouette; PCA 3D scatter; per-cluster behavioral profiles |
| 🤖 | **Executive playbooks** — retention strategies, A/B experiment ideas, grounded in the actual numbers | Groq LLaMA-3.3-70B streams narratives *from real cluster centroids and SHAP values*, with a labeled offline fallback |
| 🔬 | **A what-if sandbox** — adjust any customer attribute, watch churn probability move live | Interactive form + semi-circular risk gauge + per-prediction SHAP breakdown |

**Bring your own data** — upload any CSV; schema is auto-detected with graceful
degradation (missing target → classification disables, segmentation keeps working).
No data? A seeded 1,500-row synthetic dataset with realistic churn patterns is built in.

**The design rule that makes everything testable:** pages orchestrate, `src/` does the
work. Only one module touches Streamlit caching; the entire ML/AI core runs in CI with
no browser. Nine [Architecture Decision Records](docs/ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS.md)
document every significant choice — and the alternatives that were rejected.

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SidSadhu/NeuroScope.git
cd NeuroScope

python -m venv .venv
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1          # Windows (macOS/Linux: source .venv/bin/activate)

pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r requirements.txt

streamlit run app.py                # → http://localhost:8501
```

**Optional — live AI insights:** grab a free key at
[console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com/) and either paste it in the AI page's
sidebar, set `GROQ_API_KEY`, or add it to `.streamlit/secrets.toml`
(see [`secrets.toml.example`](.streamlit/secrets.toml.example)). Without a key the app
runs its clearly-labeled mock mode — everything else works identically.

## 📊 What the Models Actually Achieve

Trained/evaluated on the built-in dataset (1,500 rows, ~31% churn rate, stratified
80/20 split, seed 42 — fully reproducible):

| Model | Accuracy | Precision | Recall | F1 | **AUC-ROC** |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Logistic Regression** ⭐ | 0.7567 | 0.6842 | 0.4149 | 0.5166 | **0.8045** |
| Random Forest | 0.7533 | 0.6724 | 0.4149 | 0.5132 | 0.7926 |
| Gradient Boosting | 0.7533 | 0.6562 | 0.4468 | 0.5316 | 0.7871 |
| Extra Trees | 0.7300 | 0.6327 | 0.3298 | 0.4336 | 0.7758 |

**Top churn drivers (SHAP):** `support_calls_3m` → `login_frequency` →
`satisfaction_score` → `tenure_months` → `last_purchase_days`

> 📌 **Honesty section** (rare, we know): these are *synthetic-data* metrics — a
> demonstration of engineering, not market performance. Recall at the default 0.5
> threshold is ~0.42 (tune the threshold before operational use), probabilities are
> uncalibrated, and silhouettes are moderate (0.13–0.18). All of it is measured and
> documented in the [Model Card](docs/MODEL_CARD.md), because knowing what a system
> *can't* do is part of building it.

## 🧪 Engineering Highlights

The details a senior reviewer looks for:

- **SHAP version-tolerance layer** — SHAP changed its output contract (legacy list →
  2D → 3D per-class arrays). A central normalizer accepts all three layouts with
  tested fallback chains (`feature_importances_` → `coef_` → graceful degradation).
  This is the exact bug class that kills real deployments months later — handled
  up front, unit-tested per layout.
- **4-layer test suite — 87 tests, 92% coverage, 70% gate enforced** — data unit →
  ML unit (incl. every SHAP layout + fallback branch) → chart builders →
  **AppTest end-to-end tests that boot every page and click the buttons**. The E2E
  layer has already caught two bugs unit tests missed.
- **Graceful degradation everywhere** — no Groq key → mock mode; bad CSV → warnings +
  partial features; SHAP failure → fallback importances. The demo never dies on stage.
- **Streaming LLM contract** — insights are generator functions yielding chunks; the
  vendor call is 30 lines behind a swap-friendly seam, not a framework lock-in.
- **One CSS token file** — the whole dark design system lives in one `:root` block;
  rebranding is a one-file change.
- **CI matrix** — Python 3.10/3.11/3.12 × (ruff + pytest + coverage gate) on every push.

## 🧪 Testing & Code Quality

```bash
pytest                                   # 87 tests: unit + charts + E2E smoke
pytest --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing
ruff check . && ruff format --check .    # CI-enforced lint + format
streamlit run app.py                     # manual pass: train → tabs → cluster → AI
```

GitHub Actions runs the full matrix (Python 3.10–3.12) on every push and PR:
lint → format → tests → coverage gate (70% floor, currently 92%).
